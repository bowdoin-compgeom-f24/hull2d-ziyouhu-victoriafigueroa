## Project Description:
Generate n points and find and draw its convex hull if it has one.

Apply Graham Scan to find the convex hull.

No edges on the convex hull are collinear.

Include 13 initializers for points generation.

## How to run:
In terminal: `./hull2d #`, where you input desired numbers for n (replace `#`).
Press `i` to switch the next initializing pattern.

## Run time:
`O(nlgn)`
